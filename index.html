        <p>Computers evolved form being large, heavy, and capable of filling a room, to being a pocket size personal gadget. Transistors have progressively become tiny, but this progress is slowly getting to its limit. Quantum computing is a fast-growing research field that combines computer science with quantum mechanics, and seems to be the solution to the decline of the exponential growth curve of computer size, and effeciency.</p>
        <p> Quantum Computers will bring tremendous change in speed, security, healthcare simulations, and data processing in general. </p>

        <header>How Computers Operate</header>
        <p>A computer is made of components such as the memory unit, control unit, and arithmetic unit, that control mechanisms, represent, and process data. Computer chips contain modules, and those modules contain logic gates, which contain transistors.</p>
        <p> A transistor is like a switch that can either allow or block current from flowing, this is represented as bit information that is set to either 0 or 1. Transistors are combined to create logic gates and logic gates are combined to perform complex binary operations, which represent instructions given to the computer.  </p>

      <section role="region" class="main-section" id="The_Real_Problem" aria-labelledby="The_Real_Problem">
        <header>The Real Problem</header>
        <p>Computers used to be the size of a room, but Engineers discovered ways to reduce the size of different parts, and computers became smaller and smaller. Transistors shrunk to the size of only a few atoms, which makes it possible for electrons to pass themselves to the other side of a blocked passage. This process is called quantum tunneling. </p>
        <p>Technological progress is approaching a real physical barrier, and scientists are trying to use unusual quantum properties to solve this problem by building quantum computers. Normal computers use bits, but quantum computers use qubits, which can also be set to one of two values. </p>

      <section role="region" class="main-section" id="Qubit" aria-labelledby="Qubit and Its' Properties">
        <header>Qubit</header>
        <p>Normal computers use bits, but quantum computers use qubits. Some properties that makes qubit substantially unique are: </p>
        <li>Superposition</li>
        <li>Entanglement</li>
        <li>Qubit Manipulation</li>
        <h4>Superposition</h4>
        <p>There are two level quantum systems that a qubit can represent: a spin and a magnetic field, or a single photon. These systems have two possible states: 0 or 1. These states are like the photons’ horizontal or vertical polarization. The qubit does not have to be either 0 or 1, it could be in any proportion of both at once. This is called SUPERPOSITION. But when a photon goes through a filter, it must decide whether to be vertically or horizontally polarized. You can’t predict if a qubit is 0 or 1 unless you measure it. 4-qubit in superposition can be in its 16 different possible combinations and use them all at the same time. Twenty of those can store a million values in parallel. </p>
        <h4>Entanglement</h4>
        <p>Entanglement is s close connection that makes each of the qubits react to a change in the other’s state instantaneously, no matter how far they are apart. </p>
        <h4>Qubit Manipulation</h4>
        <p>A normal logic gate gets a single set of inputs and produces one definite output. But a qubit gate manipulates an input of superpositions, rotate probabilities, and produces another superposition as it output.</p>

        <p>Quantum computers will not be used for everyday personal use like your cellphone or macbook, at least in recent years to come, but below are some of the ways quantum computers can be used: </p>
        <li>Database Entry</li>
        <li>IT security</li>
        <li>Simulations</li>
        <h4>Database Entry</h4>
        <p>Normal computers may have to test every single entry to find something in a database. But quantum computers algorithm needs only the square root of the time. </p>
        <h4>IT Security</h4>
        <p> Right now, data is secured with an encryption system. Private keys/passwords can take years of trial and error to compute. But quantum computing exponential speed can do it in a breeze.</p>
        <h4>Simulations</h4>
        <p>Simulations of the quantum world require many resources and are often inaccurate with bigger structures, such as molecules. Now, we can simulate quantum physics with actual quantum physics. This can provide new insights that might revolutionize medicine. </p>
